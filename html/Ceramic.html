        <p>There are five categories in Ceramic, Which Ceramic are you Looking for:</p>

            <img src="../Images/Oxide Ceramic.PNG" alt="" srcset="">
            <button class="btn" onclick="categories('Oxide_Ceramic')">Oxide Ceramic</button>

            <p> Oxide ceramics are inorganic compounds of metallic (e.g., Al, Zr, Ti, Mg) or metalloid (Si) elements
                with oxygen. Oxides can be combined with nitrogen or carbon to form more complex oxynitride or
                oxycarbide ceramics.Oxide ceramics have high melting points.</p>

        <div class="box">

            <img src="../Images/Silicate Ceramic.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
            <button class="btn" onclick="categories('Silicate_Ceramic')">Silicate Ceramic</button>

            <p>Silicate Ceramics were the first technical ceramics developed to support early electrical technologies,
                including Magnesium Silicates (Steatite and Cordierite) and Mullite.Because of the large volumes of
                product involved, traditional ceramics tend to be manufactured from naturally occurring raw materials
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <img src="../Images/Carbide Ceramic.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
            <button class="btn" onclick="categories('Carbide_Ceramic')">Carbide Ceramic</button>
            <p>Carbide ceramics are extremely resistant against high temperature, abrasion and corrosion. They have a
                high thermal and variable electrical conductivity, and are mainly used in mechanical engineering,
                chemical, and power engineering, microelectronics as well as space engineering.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <img src="../Images/Nitride Ceramic.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
            <button class="btn" onclick="categories('Nitride_Ceramic')">Nitride Ceramic</button>
            <p>Nitride ceramics have experienced a tremendous development in the last decades. Whereas,Si3N4 and SiAlON
                based ceramics were at forefront of fundamental and research related to nitride ceramics, the field has
                expanded significantly, including more and more nitride compositions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <img src="../Images/Glass_Ceramic.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
            <button class="btn" onclick="categories('Glass_Ceramic')">Glass Ceramic</button>
            <p>Glass ceramic materials have the same chemical compositions as glasses but differ from them in that they
                are typically 95-98% crystalline by volume, with only a small percentage vitreous. The crystals
                themselves are generally very small, less than 1Âµm and most often very uniform in size.</p>
